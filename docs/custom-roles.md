# Creating custom roles

When creating a group, you have the option of showing respondents a list of
examples of roles they could have in your organization and letting them pick
which they're interested in. This page explains how to create your own custom
list of roles.

To create a list of roles, you just need to upload a text file that looks like
this:

```
Notetaker
Takes notes during meetings
Writes and shares meeting minutes

Logistics
Coordinates meeting logistics
Books meeting rooms
Sets up and tears down before and after events

Designer
Creates and distributes flyers
Designs and maintains the website
```

Each role is separated by a blank line. The first line is the name of the role,
and each line after is a responsibility or task associated with that role.
