        Not Without Help is a tool for connecting organizations with people who want to help. In
        this early iteration, it's just a form where volunteers can leave their contact information
        for organizers to get in touch.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-center">How it works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You'll fill out some information about your group and what kinds of help you're looking
          for.
        </li>
        <li>
          You'll get a link to share around and collect responses from people who want to help.
        </li>
        <li>
          Folks who are interested leave their contact information so you can reach out to them
          directly.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="text-center">Privacy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Only you can see the information people send you. Neither us nor our hosting provider have
          access to it.
        </li>
        <li>
          You don't need any sort of account to use this tool. You don't need to provide a name,
          email address, or phone number to start a group.
        </li>
        <li>
          You have control over who you authorize to view the information people send you, and you
          can revoke that access at any time.
        </li>
      </ul>
