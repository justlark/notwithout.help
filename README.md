# Not Without Help

A web app for connecting organizations with people that want to get involved.

## Architecture

The site is a Vue.js app hosted on [a
CDN](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages). The client app is in this repo
under [`./client/`](./client).

The backend is a [serverless
function](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) which uses a [SQLite
database](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/) and a [key-value
store](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/) for storage. The backend is in
this repo under [`./worker/`](./worker).

## Deployment

The client app and backend worker are automatically deployed to the dev
environment on pushes to `main` and to the prod environment on pushes to
`prod`. To deploy the worker manually, [install
Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and run:

```shell
cd ./worker/
npm install
npx wrangler deploy --env dev
npx wrangler deploy --env prod
```

You can build the client app locally like this:

```shell
cd ./client/
npm install
npm run build
```

## Development

To run the app locally, you'll need to spin up a local instance of the backend
worker. It must be running on port `8787`.

```shell
cd ./worker/
npm install
npx wrangler dev --env dev
```

Then you can start the local dev server.

```shell
cd ./client/
npm install
npm run dev
```

In the [`./tests/`](./tests/) directory you'll find a CLI tool that provides
helpers for performing the cryptographic operations necessary to authenticate
with the backend worker. This is useful for debugging the worker locally using
a tool like Postman or Hoppscotch.

To use the tool, [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and
run:

```shell
cd ./tests/
cargo run -- --help
```

In the [`./tests/`](./tests/) directory you'll also find a test suite for the
backend worker. Once you've started the backend worker running locally, you can
run the tests like this:

```shell
cd ./tests/
cargo test
```

## Documentation

You can find documentation on how this app mitigates security risks in the
[security whitepaper](./docs/security-whitepaper.md). It is recommended that
you read this document if you're planning on diving into the codebase; it
provides a lot of good information on how the client talks to the backend
worker.
