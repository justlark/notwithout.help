# Not Without Help

ðŸš§ This repo is under construction ðŸš§

A web app for connecting organizations with people that want to get involved.

How it works:

- Organizers create forms for volunteers to fill out.
- Volunteers answer some questions about the kinds of roles they're interested
  in and leave their contact information.
- Neither organizers nor volunteers need an account, email address, or phone
  number to use the app. Volunteers just follow a link to fill out the form,
  and organizers have a separate link to view the responses.
- Only the organizers can see the volunteers' responses. Neither the website
  owner nor the hosting provider have access to them.
